The main objectives of this project are twofold:

* Proof of skill in using programming languages, libraries, etc.

* Proof of work history to date

There are two methods of proof expected:

* Proof by the person who is entering the information

* Proof from a third party

The more skills you have, the higher your individual points (which are not monetary in value), but even if you have the same skills, the more points you will get if proof is from a third party.
