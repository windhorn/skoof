# skoof

The main objectives of this project are twofold:

- Proof of skill in using programming languages, libraries, etc.

- Proof of work history to date

There are two methods of proof expected:

- Proof by the person who is entering the information

- Proof from a third party

The more skills you have, the higher your individual points (which are not monetary in value), but even if you have the same skills, the more points you will get if proof is from a third party.

Main functions
* Proof of skills for those who want to prove their skills
  * Proof of identity is mainly done via smartphone or PC.
* Points are awarded according to skills.
  * Identity can be verified by the user, but more points are awarded if verified by someone else.
* Proof of the prover's work history.
  * By taking advantage of the benefits of zero-knowledge proof, work history can be verified while company names are hidden.
  * Proof of work history refers to the following:
    * Number of work experiences
    * Average length of employment
    * Projects in charge
    * Evaluation from members
